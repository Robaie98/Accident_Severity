# Accident Severity Predictive Machine Learning Model
Traffic accidents are one of the daily incidents within any community that causes severe property damage, serious injuries, and high number of fatalities. According to Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), there is a car accident for every 4 minutes while a person dies due to some of these accidents every 20 hours. Governments around the world invest heavily in making roads safer and reducing this threatening danger. To take protective measures against such incidents, individuals are advised to comply with certain laws and avoid some conditions when driving is dangerous. However, would not it be useful if one could predict the severity of an accident given some conditions are present when driving? For example, if it was raining and dark outside and you planned to visit a friend but you wanted to know whether driving with these conditions would result in an accident. Moreover, how severe that accident would be if the road was wet and it involved some intersections. This project, as  part of Coursera Data Science Capstone, aims to create a machine learning model to predict the severity of a car accident that could occur given some conditions are present.

The project's objective is to predict the severity of car accident that could occur based on given features. These features include weather condition, driving speed, light condition, and others. The predicted severity levels are: 
-  Fatal
-  Serious Injury 
-  Injury
-  Propery Damage


Since the predicted variable is categorical, a machine learning classification model is trained by
Seattle Geo Data.
